#Dataset: 
In this experiment, we adopted and reconstructed the dataset from the publication [1], [2] containing 260 expired drugs as corrosion inhibitors. There are two attributes in the dataset, namely chemical property features including HOMO energy (eV), LUMO energy (eV), ionization potential (I (eV)), electron affinity (A (eV)), electronegativity (χ (eV)), electrophilicity (ω (eV)), global hardness (η (eV)), global softness (σ (eV)), molecular weight (MW (g/mol)), polar surface area (PSA (Å2)), polarizability (Å3), acid dissociation constant (pKa), octanol-water partition coefficient (log P), water solubility (log S), and fraction of shared electrons (∆N) as input, and CIE (%) value as output, as shown in the examples in Figure 1.
